They can do grocery shopping, dine at restaurants, shop at the various fashion outlets, watch movies, etc.. Shopping malls are like a one-stop destination for all types of shoppers. For retailers, the central location and the large crowd at the shopping malls provides a great distribution channel to market their products and services. Property developers are also taking advantage of this trend to build more shopping malls to cater to the demand. As a result, there are many shopping malls in the city of Hyderabad and many more are being built. Opening shopping malls allows property developers to earn consistent rental income. Of course, as with any business decision, opening a new shopping mall requires serious consideration and is a lot more complicated than it seems. Particularly, the location of the shopping mall is one of the most important decisions that will determine whether the mall will be a success or a failure.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Location :"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Hyderabad is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana.
