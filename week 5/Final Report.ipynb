Introduction:\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For many shoppers, visiting shopping malls is a great way to relax and enjoy themselves during weekends and holidays. They can do grocery shopping, dine at restaurants, shop at the various fashion outlets, watch movies, etc.. Shopping malls are like a one-stop destination for all types of shoppers. For retailers, the central location and the large crowd at the shopping malls provides a great distribution channel to market their products and services. Property developers are also taking advantage of this trend to build more shopping malls to cater to the demand. As a result, there are many shopping malls in the city of Hyderabad and many more are being built. Opening shopping malls allows property developers to earn consistent rental income. Of course, as with any business decision, opening a new shopping mall requires serious consideration and is a lot more complicated than it seems. Particularly, the location of the shopping mall is one of the most important decisions that will determine whether the mall will be a success or a failure.\n\nThe objective of this capstone project is to analyze and select the best locations in the city of Hyderabad, India to open a new shopping mall. Using data science methodology and machine learning techniques like clustering, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: In the city of Hyderabad, India, if a property developer is looking to open a new shopping mall, where would you recommend to open it?\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Data Section"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To solve the problem, we will need the following data:\n\n\u2022\tList of neighbourhoods in Hyderabad. This defines the scope of this project which is confined to the city of Hyderabad, India.\n\n\u2022\tLatitude and longitude coordinates of those neighbourhoods. This is required in order to plot the map and also to get the venue data.\n\n\u2022\tVenue data, particularly data related to shopping malls. We will use this data to perform clustering on the neighbourhoods.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Foursquare API"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific city. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 2000 meter.\n\n\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighborhood\n2. Neighborhood Latitude\n3. Neighborhood Longitude\n4. Venue\n5. Venue Latitude\n6. Venue Longitude\n7. Venue Category(Shopping mall)\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 3. Methodology Section\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Firstly, we need to get the list of neighbourhoods in the city of Hyderabad. Fortunately, the list is available in the page (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_of_Hyderabad,_India). I will do web scraping using Python requests and beautiful-soup packages to extract the list of neighbourhoods data. However, this is just a list of names. I need to get the geographical coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude in order to be able to use Foursquare API. To do so, we will use the wonderful Geocoder package that will allow us to convert address into geographical coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude. After gathering the data, we will populate the data into a pandas DataFrame and then visualize the neighbourhoods in a map using Folium package. This allows us to perform a sanity check to make sure that the geographical coordinates data returned by Geocoder are correctly plotted in the city of Hyderabad.\n\nNext, we will use Foursquare API to get the top 100 venues that are within a radius of 2000 meters. We need to register a Foursquare Developer Account in order to obtain the Foursquare ID and Foursquare secret key. We then make API calls to Foursquare passing in the geographical coordinates of the neighbourhoods in a Python loop. Foursquare will return the venue data in JSON format and we will extract the venue name, venue category, venue latitude and longitude. With the data, we can check how many venues were returned for each neighbourhood and examine how many unique categories can be curated from all the returned venues. Then, we will analyse each neighbourhood by grouping the rows by neighbourhood and taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. By doing so, we are also preparing the data for use in clustering. Since we are analysing the \u201cShopping Mall\u201d data, we will filter the \u201cShopping Mall\u201d as venue category for the neighbourhoods.\n\nLastly, we will perform clustering on the data by using k-means clustering. K-means clustering algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible. It is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms and is particularly suited to solve the problem for this project. We will cluster the neighbourhoods into  \u201c3\u201d clusters based on their frequency of occurrence for \u201cShopping Mall\u201d. The results will allow us to identify which neighbourhoods have higher concentration of shopping malls while which neighbourhoods have fewer number of shopping malls. Based on the occurrence of shopping malls in different neighbourhoods, it will help us to answer the question as to which neighbourhoods are most suitable to open new shopping malls.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 4. Results Section"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": " The results from the k-means clustering show that we can categorize the neighbourhoods into 3 clusters based on the frequency of occurrence for \u201cShopping Mall\u201d:\n\n \n\n\n\u2022\tCluster 0: Neighbourhoods withlow number to no existence  of shopping malls\n\n\u2022\tCluster 1: Neighbourhoods with high concentration of shopping malls\n\n\u2022\tCluster 2:Neighbourhoods with  moderate no. of shopping malls\n\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 5.

To answer the business question that was raised in the introduction section, the answer proposed by this project is: The neighbourhoods in cluster 2 are the most preferred locations to open a new shopping mall. The findings of this project will help the relevant stakeholders to capitalize on the opportunities on high potential locations while avoiding overcrowded areas in their decisions to open a new shopping mall."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 7.
